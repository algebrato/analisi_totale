# Holograpy Analysis Tool

Holography Analysis Tool (HAT) is a featuring extraction framework from holography reconstructed images. 

Nowadays the framework is composed by several python script that performed the extraction of each crystal area of every reconstructed images. 
The crysals, into the images, are authomatic extracted using one of the clustering algoritm provided by `scipy.ndimage` package.

Is possible to get also some statistical data about the average area of the crystals. 

Packages requirements are:

1. matplotlib
2. scipy
3. PIL
4. numpy
